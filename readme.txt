This is a simple typing tool that I made to practice some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It makes a get request to a random fact generator that is used as the prompt for the typing challenge. As the user types, their key inputs will be compared with the string that is received, and will be prompted to put in the correct character. At the end of the challenge, they will receive some basic stats about their typing session. They can then choose to play again if they would like.
